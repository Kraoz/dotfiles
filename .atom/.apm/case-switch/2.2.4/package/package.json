You just have to choose what case you want the text to be.\n\n* `alt-c ctrl-c` switches selected text to camelCase\n* `alt-c ctrl-s` switches selected text to snake_case\n* `alt-c ctrl-k` switches selected text to kebab-case\n\n## Toggling through cases\nEasily toggle through the cases for a selected text. This is probably the most useful command. *currently the text isn't selected anymore after switching - this will be fixed soon.*\n\n(Default: `alt-c ctrl-t` on OS X)\n\n# Roadmap\n* fix toggle function loosing selection\n\n# Contribution\nFeel free to open up a pull request or an issue to request a feature or to report a bug.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/andersennl/case-switch/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/andersennl/case-switch#readme","_id":"case-switch@2.2.4","_shasum":"f84be08258d50b41a144845ef5041888facc555e","_resolved":"file:../d-117113-3344-2ptx3g/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117113-3344-2ptx3g/package.tgz"}
